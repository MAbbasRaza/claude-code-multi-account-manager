<h1 align="center">Claude Code Multi-Account Manager (<code>ccm</code>)</h1>

<p align="center">Switch between Claude Code accounts without signing in again.</p>

Claude Code stores exactly one account's authentication state at a time. Signing into a second
account overwrites the first one's refresh token, so returning to an account you used ten
minutes ago requires a full browser authorization round trip. `ccm` parks each account's state
in a vault and swaps it back in on demand, turning an account switch into an offline, sub-second
operation.

```text
$ ccm list
* work       jc@example.com        max
  personal   me@example.com        pro

$ ccm use personal
Captured outgoing account jc@example.com (updated "work").
Switched to "personal" (me@example.com).
Restart Claude Code for the new account to take effect.
```

Ships as a CLI, a desktop app, a system tray app, and a VS Code extension, all over one shared
core.

| Surface | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `ccm` CLI | Terminal-first, scriptable, `--json` for automation |
| `ccm-gui` desktop app | A window: list, switch, capture, rename, remove, diagnostics, settings |
| `ccm-tray` | One-click switching from the system tray |
| VS Code extension | Status bar account, switch and manage without leaving the editor |

---

## The problem, precisely

Your account identity lives in two files, and **each file is shared with state that has nothing
to do with your account**:

| File | Account keys | Also contains |
|---|---|---|
| `.credentials.json` | `claudeAiOauth` (access token, refresh token, expiry, scopes, plan) | `mcpOAuth`: one OAuth entry per MCP server you have ever linked |
| `.claude.json` | `oauthAccount`, `userID` | Per-project history, MCP configuration, trust decisions, onboarding state. Commonly tens of thousands of lines. |

There is exactly one slot for `claudeAiOauth` and one for `oauthAccount`. `/login` overwrites
both. Claude Code has no `login` or `logout` subcommand, only in-session slash commands and
`claude setup-token`.

### Why the obvious fixes are wrong

This is where most switchers go wrong, and it is worth understanding before trusting any of them
(including this one) with your credentials.

**Swapping `.credentials.json` wholesale destroys your MCP logins.** The file holds one
`claudeAiOauth` object next to a `mcpOAuth` map containing every connector you have authorized.
Replace the file and you re-authorize Gmail, Slack, Vercel, Linear and the rest on every single
switch. `ccm` replaces one key and leaves the `mcpOAuth` subtree byte-identical; there is a test
that asserts exactly that.

**Giving each account its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` forks your whole setup.** That directory also
holds `settings.json`, plugins, skills, agents, output styles and project history. Isolating per
account means maintaining N copies of all of it. `ccm` keeps one shared configuration and swaps
only the authentication.

**A one-time snapshot goes stale silently.** Claude Code refreshes your access token in the
background, and OAuth refresh tokens rotate when used. A profile saved once at add time holds a
superseded refresh token within hours, which is why several tools in this space "work once, then
stop". `ccm` re-reads the live credentials and writes them back to the outgoing profile *before*
installing the incoming one. This is the single most important thing it does.

## Install

Download an installer from
[Releases](https://github.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/releases/latest) and
run it. Each one installs the CLI, the desktop app and the tray app together, and puts `ccm` on
your `PATH`.

| Platform | File | |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `ccm-setup-windows.exe` | Per-user. No administrator rights, no UAC prompt. |
| macOS | `ccm-macos.pkg` | Installs into `/Applications`. Asks for your password. |
| Ubuntu, Debian | `ccm-linux-amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./ccm-linux-amd64.deb` |

The Windows installer lets you pick which parts you want: the desktop app, the tray app, Start
Menu shortcuts, a desktop shortcut, and whether the tray starts at login. All are on by default.
Everything except the two programs themselves can also be changed afterwards, on any platform,
from the desktop app's Settings or with `ccm shortcut` and `ccm autostart`.

> **These builds are not signed yet, and both operating systems will say so.** That warning is
> expected. Verify the download against `SHA256SUMS` rather than trusting a publisher name.
>
> **macOS** will not open an unsigned package from Finder at all. Install it from Terminal:
> ```bash
> sudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/ccm-macos.pkg -target /
> ```
> **Windows** shows *"Windows protected your PC"*. Choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

### Command line only

If you just want `ccm` and no desktop apps:

**macOS and Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

These two detect your architecture, verify the download against the published `SHA256SUMS`,
install into your home directory, and tell you how to fix your `PATH` if needed. Unlike the
macOS and Debian packages above, neither ever asks for `sudo` or administrator rights.

They can install the extra surfaces too, though as loose binaries rather than real applications:
on macOS that means no Dock icon and no application identity, which is what `ccm-macos.pkg`
exists to provide.

```bash
CCM_GUI=1 CCM_TRAY=1 curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh     # macOS, Linux
```

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Gui -Tray                                # Windows
```

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install</summary>

**Homebrew** (macOS, Linux)

```bash
brew install MAbbasRaza/tap/ccm
```

**Scoop** (Windows) — installs straight from the manifest, no bucket to add:

```powershell
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/main/packaging/scoop/ccm.json
```

**Go** — if you already have a toolchain:

```bash
go install github.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/cmd/ccm@latest
```

**Manually** — download from
[Releases](https://github.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager/releases), check it
against `SHA256SUMS`, rename it to `ccm`, and put it on your `PATH`.

**From source** — requires Go 1.25 or later:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAbbasRaza/claude-code-multi-account-manager.git
cd claude-code-multi-account-manager
go build -o ccm ./cmd/ccm
go test ./... -count=1

go build -o ccm-tray ./cmd/ccm-tray   # optional; needs cgo, and
                                      # libayatana-appindicator3-dev on Linux
```

A `Makefile` wraps the common targets (`make build`, `make test`, `make check`). See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the architecture map and the three invariants any change
must preserve.

</details>

**VS Code extension** — download `ccm-extension.vsix` from the release, then:

```bash
code --install-extension ccm-extension.vsix
```

### Uninstall

| Installed with | Remove with |
|---|---|
| `ccm-setup-windows.exe` | Settings > Apps > Claude Code Multi-Account Manager |
| `ccm-macos.pkg` | `sudo ccm-uninstall` |
| `ccm-linux-amd64.deb` | `sudo apt remove ccm` |
| `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, manual | Delete the binaries |

**None of them delete your saved accounts.** That is deliberate: the vault holds the credentials
for every account you added, and destroying it would force a browser sign-in for each one to
recover. Remove it yourself if you actually want it gone:
`~/Library/Application Support/ccm` on macOS, `~/.config/ccm` and `~/.local/share/ccm` on Linux,
`%APPDATA%\ccm` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ccm` on Windows. Nothing is written outside those locations
and your own Claude Code config directory.

## Getting started

```bash
ccm init                # detect and pin your Claude Code config directory
ccm add work            # capture the account you are signed into now
                        # then /login as your other account
ccm add personal        # capture that one too
ccm use work            # switch back, no browser
```

**Capture before you sign out.** `/logout` destroys the refresh token, and once it is gone there
is nothing left for `ccm` to save. Run `ccm add` first, every time.

Full walkthrough, including the tray app, the VS Code extension and troubleshooting:
[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

Adding an account requires one ordinary sign-in per account; there is no supported way to mint a
session offline. After that, switching never touches the network.

You can also skip `ccm add` entirely: when `ccm use` sees a signed-in account it does not
recognize, it parks it as a new profile rather than discarding it. Profiles accumulate simply by
signing in normally.

--force, -f                    proceed even if Claude Code is running
```

## Configuration

`ccm` resolves which Claude Code installation to manage through five levels, highest first:

1. `--config-dir <path>`
2. `CCM_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
3. `claudeConfigDir` in ccm's settings file, written by `ccm init`
4. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, when inherited
5. Platform default (`~/.claude`)

Level 3 exists for a specific reason. If you export `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` from `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`
or a PowerShell profile, a shell-launched CLI inherits it but a tray app or VS Code window
launched from your desktop does not. Those two would then manage different directories, and the
GUI one would quietly operate on a stale installation. `ccm init` pins the answer so every
surface agrees. `ccm doctor` re-resolves all five levels and warns when they disagree.

Settings file location (override with `CCM_HOME`):

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\ccm\config.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ccm/config.json` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ccm/config.json` |

```json
{
  "claudeConfigDir": "/path/to/claude/config",
  "vaultPath": "",
  "requireClosedSessions": true,
  "credentialsBackend": "auto"
}
```

### macOS over SSH or in tmux

On macOS Claude Code keeps credentials in the Keychain, which is unavailable in exactly the
situations where switching accounts is most useful: an SSH session, a tmux pane detached from the
login session, or CI. Claude Code falls back to reading `~/.claude/.credentials.json` when that
file exists, so you can point `ccm` at the file instead:

```bash
ccm config set credentialsBackend file
# or, for one command only:
CCM_CREDENTIALS_BACKEND=file ccm use work
```

Valid values are `auto` (default, the platform's normal store), `file`, and `keychain`.

`ccm`'s own vault has the same problem for the same reason: on macOS it is encrypted under a key
that also lives in the login keychain, so a session that cannot reach the keychain cannot read or
write the vault either. If you see this:

```text
the macOS login keychain is locked for this session, which is normal over SSH or in a
LaunchAgent that starts before login
```

either unlock it first with `security unlock-keychain`, run `ccm` from a graphical login session,
or accept a weaker vault:

```bash
CCM_VAULT_BACKEND=file ccm list
```

That stores the vault as a plain file with mode `0600`, exactly what `ccm` does on Linux, instead
of AES-256-GCM. It is opt-in rather than an automatic fallback because it is a downgrade, and
silently weakening a file full of refresh tokens is not a decision `ccm` should make for you.
Switching backends never risks the vault: the envelope records which scheme wrote it, and `ccm`
refuses to open a vault sealed under a different one rather than guessing.

Valid values are `auto` (default), `keychain` and `file` on macOS; `auto` and `file` on Linux,
where they mean the same thing; and `auto` or `dpapi` on Windows, which has nothing to escape from
because DPAPI works in every session. An unrecognised value is rejected rather than ignored, so a
typo cannot leave you believing the vault is sealed one way while it is sealed another.

## Where your tokens are stored

**The vault is never less protected than Claude Code's own credential store on the same
platform.** That rule decides the implementation:

| Platform | Claude Code stores credentials as | `ccm` vault |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | plaintext file | DPAPI, bound to your user account (stronger) |
| macOS | Keychain | AES-256-GCM under a key held in the Keychain (equivalent) |
| Linux | plaintext file, mode 0600 | file, mode 0600 (equivalent) |

Vaults are not portable between machines or users; on Windows and macOS the protection is bound
to the local account. Every write to your real Claude Code files is preceded by a timestamped
backup of both documents.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model.

## VS Code extension

In `extension/`. Adds a status bar item showing the active account, a **Claude: Switch Account**
command, capture and doctor commands, and a Reload Window prompt after a switch. It shells out to
`ccm --json` and contains no switching logic of its own, so there is one implementation to audit.

```bash
cd extension && npm install && npm run compile
```

## Limitations

Stated plainly, because each one will otherwise look like a bug.

1. **A switch takes effect when Claude Code next starts.** Credentials are read at startup, so a
   running session keeps using the previous account. `ccm` refuses to switch while Claude Code is
   running; pass `--force` if you know what you are doing.

2. **Parked accounts still expire.** A `/login` session has a finite lifetime independent of
   access token refresh. When it lapses, Claude Code reports `Login expired · Please run /login`
   and no amount of capture-on-switch avoids signing in again. `ccm doctor` shows expiry per
   profile.

3. **The macOS Keychain backend is not covered by the automated end-to-end tests.** It is
   implemented and it compiles and unit-tests on macOS in CI, but the full switch cycle has been
   exercised on Windows only. Treat the first macOS switch as something to verify, and note that
   `ccm` backs up both documents before writing.

4. **These file formats are internal to Claude Code and unversioned.** They have already changed
   within the 2.1.x series. `ccm` validates the shape it finds and fails loudly rather than
   writing something Claude Code cannot read, but a future release could still break it.

5. **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is deliberately not used.** It sits above subscription credentials
   in Claude Code's authentication precedence, so it would mask whichever account you switched to,
   and it has been reported to delete macOS Keychain credentials on exit
   ([anthropics/claude-code#37512](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37512)).

`ccm` differs in preserving `mcpOAuth` and unrelated `.claude.json` state through a key-scoped
merge, capturing tokens on the way out so profiles do not rot, resolving the config directory
explicitly rather than trusting an inherited environment variable, and refusing to switch under a
running Claude Code process.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), which covers the
development setup, the architecture, and the three invariants that silently corrupt state when
broken.

Two things worth knowing up front:

- **Never test against your real account.** Every test here uses synthetic tokens in a temporary
  directory. The contributing guide explains how to build a scratch installation.
- **macOS verification is especially valuable.** The Keychain backend is implemented and unit
  tested, but the full switch cycle has only ever been exercised on Windows.
